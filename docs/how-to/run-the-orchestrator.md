# How to run the orchestrator on a feature

This guide shows you how to take a feature whose plan (`tasks.md`) is ready and
drive it to completion with `lab/engine/orchestrate.py`: launch the run in the
background, pick an autonomy level, respond to a blocking checkpoint, and resume
after a stop.

It assumes the three artifacts already exist in `work/<feature>/`
(`spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) and that `tasks.md` is the plan you intend
to execute. If you still need to generate the plan, do that first (see the
[getting-started tutorial](../tutorials/getting-started.md)); this guide starts
once a plan exists and ends when the run reaches its final (merge) checkpoint.

## Prerequisites

- The `claude` CLI installed and **authenticated** (the orchestrator calls it headless).
- `uv` installed (used for `pytest`/evals).
- A feature directory `work/<feature>/` containing `tasks.md`.
- `tasks.md` frontmatter set to `status: approved` — the orchestrator refuses an
  unapproved plan (`--dry-run` and `--force` are the only ways past this).
- `LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET` exported **if your plan has any checkpoint**. A plan with
  a checkpoint refuses to start without it (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).

Set the approval secret once per shell session:

    export LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

Keep this secret out of the agents' environment — the orchestrator strips it
before each agent call, so do not echo it into `tasks.md` or any artifact.

## Steps

### 1. Lint the plan

Validate the DAG before anything runs. A plan that does not lint does not run.

    python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/<feature> --validate
    # or: just validate work/<feature>

This checks the acyclic graph, that spec IDs exist, `done_when` is present,
parallel paths touch disjoint files, the final checkpoint is `blocking`, and
every `verify` command is on the allowlist. It also prints the `verify` commands
that will run on the host — read them, because approving the plan means signing
off on those commands. Exit code is non-zero if there are errors. Fix any error
and re-run before proceeding.

### 2. Preview the execution plan (optional)

See the waves and checkpoints without executing or spending anything:

    python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/<feature> --dry-run

This is autonomy level **L0 — plan**: nothing runs, no agent is called.

### 3. Launch the run in the background

On macOS, wrap the run in `caffeinate -i` so the machine does not sleep mid-run,
and redirect output to a log file:

    caffeinate -i python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/<feature> \
      > work/<feature>/.runs/run.log 2>&1 &

This is the default autonomy level **L2 — cruise**: the run pauses only at the
`blocking` checkpoints of the approved plan; `auto` checkpoints self-validate
when evals are green and the reviewer panel returns PASS.

To run in the foreground instead (still `caffeinate`-wrapped), use the justfile:

    just run work/<feature>

### 4. Choose an autonomy level

Pick the flag that matches how closely you want to supervise this run:

- **L0 — plan**: `--dry-run`. Nothing runs. Use it to inspect waves.
- **L1 — supervised**: `--supervised` (or `just run work/<feature> supervised=1`).
  Every checkpoint pauses for you, even ones the plan marked `auto`.
- **L2 — cruise** *(default)*: no flag. Only the `blocking` checkpoints pause.

The **merge** is never automatic at any level: plan-lint rejects a plan whose
final checkpoint is `auto`, so the last decision is always yours.

For the full flag table, see the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.md).

### 5. Respond to a blocking checkpoint

When the run hits a blocking checkpoint it pauses, sends a notification, and
prints a line like:

    ⏸  CP-1 — waiting for work/<feature>/.approvals/CP-1 (or .rejected)

Before you decide, read the reviewer report the orchestrator wrote for that
checkpoint:

    work/<feature>/.runs/CP-1-review.md

It carries the panel's aggregated verdict (PASS / WARN / BLOCK) and each
panelist's findings with `file:line`. Then either approve or reject.

**Approve** — write the signed token the orchestrator is waiting for:

    lab/engine/approve.sh CP-1 work/<feature>

The token is HMAC-signed with `LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET`, verified, then consumed
(it cannot be replayed). The run resumes on the next poll.

**Reject** — reopen the targeted tasks with a reason passed verbatim to the agent:

    lab/engine/reject.sh CP-1 work/<feature> "the quote doesn't show the discount" T2

Omit the task IDs to reopen all tasks the checkpoint covers. The reopened tasks
re-run with your feedback attached, then the checkpoint is presented again. After
more than two rejections of the same checkpoint, the run stops and requires a
manual resume.

### 6. Watch progress

Follow the run as it advances:

    tail -f work/<feature>/.runs/run.log

The live status line (`.claude/statusline.py`, wired in `settings.json`) reflects
the run state from `state.json`. See the [status-line reference](../reference/status-line.md).

### 7. Resume after a stop

If the run stops — budget cap reached, a node blocked or failed, too many
checkpoint rejections, or you killed it — fix the cause, then **re-run the exact
same command**:

    caffeinate -i python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/<feature> \
      > work/<feature>/.runs/run.log 2>&1 &

Resume reads `work/<feature>/.runs/state.json`: `done` nodes are not replayed.
A node that ended `blocked` recorded an open question (OQ) in `spec.md` §8 —
answer it before resuming, and the node retries. A truncated `state.json` (from a
hard kill mid-write) does not crash the resume; the run restarts cleanly instead.

### 8. Finish

The run ends on a summary that lists each node's final status and the total agent
cost. When all tasks are done, the final (merge) checkpoint is the human decision
that closes the feature — it is never auto-validated.

## Where logs and state live

Everything for a run lives under `work/<feature>/.runs/` and
`work/<feature>/.approvals/`:

- `.runs/state.json` — node statuses; the resume source of truth (written atomically).
- `.runs/run.log` — the run's stdout/stderr (if you redirected as above).
- `.runs/journal.jsonl` — one JSON line per event (attempt, duration, per-agent cost, verdict, summary).
- `.runs/CP-n-review.md` — the reviewer panel report for checkpoint `CP-n`.
- `.runs/orchestrator.lock` — the per-feature OS lock held for the duration of the run.
- `<git-dir>/lab-orchestrator.lock` — the repo-level OS lock: one orchestrator per repository (git commits are repo-global). Lives in the git dir, never committed.
- `.approvals/CP-n` — a pending signed approval token; renamed to `.handled-…` once consumed.
- `.approvals/CP-n.rejected` — a pending rejection; renamed to `.handled-…` once read.

These paths are denied to the agents' edit tools by `.claude/settings.json`.

## Troubleshooting

### The run aborts with "orchestrator lock already held"

A second orchestrator was started on the same feature while the first is still
running (an OS `flock` on `.runs/orchestrator.lock` fails the second one fast).
Wait for the active run to finish. If the previous process died without releasing
the lock, the lock is stale — delete the file and re-run:

    rm work/<feature>/.runs/orchestrator.lock

### The run aborts with "repo lock already held … driving this repository"

A different orchestrator is already driving this **repository** (possibly on another
feature). Only one driver per repo is allowed, because git's index and commit history
are repo-global and are only serialized within a single process — two drivers would
interleave commits and race the index. Let the active run finish. If its process died
without releasing the lock, delete the stale lock (it lives in the git dir) and re-run:

    rm "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/lab-orchestrator.lock"

### Driving an external project: confirm the resolved paths

When you drive a separate repo (`--project <path>` or `just run-project`), the
orchestrator echoes the resolved build root and feature at startup:

    Project (build + git root): /abs/path/to/project
    Feature: /abs/path/to/project/work/<feature>

Check these are the repo you meant. A backgrounded `cd … &` does **not** move your
foreground shell, so it is easy to launch a run — or run a gate by hand — from the wrong
directory. The orchestrator itself always commits and gates under the resolved `PROJECT`
(absolute), so the echoed lines are the source of truth; if they are wrong, the launch
command's `--project`/cwd is wrong.

### The run refuses to start: "LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET not set"

Your plan has a checkpoint, and without a signing secret any `.approvals/<CP>`
file an agent could write via Bash would be honored — so the orchestrator
fails closed. Export the secret (recommended):

    export LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

Only if you knowingly accept unsigned, forgeable approvals, opt out:

    LAB_ALLOW_UNSIGNED_APPROVALS=1 python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/<feature>

### The run refuses to start: status is not "approved"

The orchestrator runs only an approved plan. Set `status: approved` in the
`tasks.md` frontmatter once you (the Owner) have signed off on the lint output.

### An approval is rejected as forged / "approval REJECTED"

The token in `.approvals/CP-n` failed signature verification (wrong or missing
secret, or a hand-edited token). The orchestrator discards it (renamed
`.invalid-…`) and keeps waiting. Re-create a valid token with `lab/engine/approve.sh`
in a shell that has the same `LAB_APPROVAL_SECRET` that started the run.

### The run stopped on budget

`LAB_BUDGET_USD` was reached and the run stopped before the next wave. Review the
cost in `.runs/journal.jsonl`, raise or unset the cap, then resume with the same
command.
