"""Background orchestrator for the AI-native lab.

Reads a feature's tasks.md, builds the DAG (depends_on), runs the ready tasks
IN PARALLEL via `claude -p` (headless), passes the eval gate after each task
(max 3 iterations), and handles checkpoints according to their mode:
  - `mode: blocking` (default) — pause + notification, human validation via
        lab/engine/approve.sh CP-1 <feature_dir>
  - `mode: auto` — auto-validated if and only if the FULL gate is green AND reviewer
        PASS; otherwise falls back to blocking. The final (merge) checkpoint is ALWAYS
        blocking, and additionally gates a clean checkout of HEAD (see guardrails).

Autonomy levels:
    --dry-run       show the plan, nothing runs
    --supervised    force all checkpoints to blocking (ignore auto modes)
    (default)       cruise: respect the modes of the plan approved by the Owner
    --validate      plan-lint: check tasks.md and exit (to be run by the planner
                    BEFORE proposing the plan, and by the Owner before approving)

Autonomy guardrails:
  - structured verdict: the implementer ends with STATUS: done|blocked — an agent
    blocked on a spec gap (OQ) never passes for finished
  - anti-empty-gate: a task that implements spec IDs fails if NO eval is
    collected (no eval written = no done, even if `just evals` exits 0)
  - failure containment: a failed/blocked task only blocks its own subtree of
    dependents (skipped); the other branches continue
  - scoped commits: we only stage the task's files_touched + the feature
    directory under lock (never `git add -A`, nor `tests`/`evals` wholesale which
    would suck in the files of other tasks and the goldens — findings H3/H5)
  - fail-closed scope (finding L-1): if the working tree carries changes outside the
    declared plan scope, the commit is REFUSED (not silently dropped) and the task is
    routed back — dropping them would ship a merge green in the tree but broken at HEAD
  - authoritative gate: a checkpoint runs the FULL gate (lint+test+evals+brand), not
    evals alone, and re-runs it the moment a wave commits a dependency manifest; the
    merge checkpoint ALSO gates a clean checkout of HEAD (throwaway worktree) so a
    working-tree≠HEAD divergence cannot slip through as green

Usage:
    python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/my-feature --validate
    python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/my-feature --dry-run
    caffeinate -i python3 lab/engine/orchestrate.py work/my-feature &   # runs in background

Prerequisites: claude CLI installed and authenticated; tasks.md with status: approved
(frontmatter) — the orchestrator refuses an unvalidated plan (Cognition pattern).
